# Shade

A Flutter app for those who are interested in computer graphics, especially procedural content generation using ray marching and signed distance functions (SDFs). 

**Shade** works by integrating **OpenGL** which is a graphics API into Flutter. Everything you can see rendered in shade are just pure functions. No need for loading object data or whatever. Just input a function that describes your object, and voila, Shade does the rest for you. The lighting, shadows and everything are all calculated. 

With Shade, we are making it possible for anyone to create massive virtual worlds without having to have a laptop. All you need is your mobile phone.
